# Effect of tDCS on memory


You are going to analyze data from a study in which 34 elderly subjects were given anodal (activating) tDCS over their left tempero-parietal junction (TPJ). Subjects were instructed to learn association between images and pseudo-words (data were inspired by @antonenkoTDCSinducedEpisodicMemory2019).

Episodic memory is measured by percentage of correctly recalled word-image pairings. We also have response times for correct decisions.

Each subject was tested 5 times in the TPJ stimulation condition, and a further 5 times in a sham stimulation condition.

The variables in the dataset are:

```
subject: subject ID
stimulation: TPJ or sham (control)
block: block
age: age
correct: accuracy per block
rt: mean RTs for correct responses
```

You are mainly interested in whether recall ability is better during the TPJ stimulation condition than during sham.


```{r}
d <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kogpsy/neuroscicomplab/main/data/tdcs-tpj.csv")
```


```{r}
glimpse(d)
```

```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(across(c(subject, stimulation, block), ~as_factor(.))) %>% 
  drop_na()
```



:::exercise

- specify a linear model

- specify a null model

- estimate a Bayes factor for the effect of TPJ stimulation
    + using the Savage-Dickey density ratio test
    + using the bridge sampling method

- control for subjects' age
