However, in the model we assumed that both groups had the same standard deviations. This assumption is not really necessary, however, as we can easily fit a model in which we allow both mean and standard deviation to vary between groups.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(brms)\n\ntheme_set(theme_grey(base_size = 14) +\n            theme(panel.grid = element_blank()))\n\n\n\nGenerate data\n\n\nN <- 10\n\nmean_a <- 20.0\nsigma_a <- 2.0\n\nmean_b <- 16.0\nsigma_b <- 1.5\n\nset.seed(12)\nd <- tibble(A = rnorm(N, mean_a, sigma_a),\n            B = rnorm(N, mean_b, sigma_b))\nd <- d |>\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"group\",\n                values_to = \"score\") |> \n  mutate(group = as_factor(group)) |> \n  arrange(group)\n\n\n\nbrms allows us easily fit both the main parameter (in this case the mean), as well as further distributional parameters. We simply need to wrap the formula in the bf() function. Therefore, instead of the formula score ~ group we can use this bf(score ~ group, sigma ~ group).\n\n\nscore ~ group\n\n\n\nCan be replaced with:\n\n\nbf(score ~ group, sigma ~ group)\n\n\n\n\nPerform the steps described in the walkthrough, but this time for the model that allows both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) to vary. Does this model perform well? Are you able to recover the true parameter values?\nNOTE: The standard deviation must be positive; therefore we are predicting log(sigma) with our linear predictor. To recover the parameter on the original scale, you need to use the inverse function, which is the exponential function exp().\nTry it out; if you get stuck, you can always ask questions on Zulip.\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nget_prior(bf(score ~ group, sigma ~ group),\n          data = d)\n\n\n                   prior     class   coef group resp  dpar nlpar\n                  (flat)         b                              \n                  (flat)         b groupB                       \n student_t(3, 16.9, 2.5) Intercept                              \n                  (flat)         b                   sigma      \n                  (flat)         b groupB            sigma      \n    student_t(3, 0, 2.5) Intercept                   sigma      \n bound       source\n            default\n       (vectorized)\n            default\n       (vectorized)\n       (vectorized)\n            default\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nm3 <- brm(bf(score ~ group, sigma ~ group),\n          prior = prior(normal(0, 4), class = b),\n          data = d, \n          file = \"models/m3\")\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\nconditional_effects(m3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\npp_check(m3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n\npp_check(m3, type = \"dens_overlay_grouped\", group = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While reading your expectations and questions regarding this workshop, it became clear that all of your points can be approached within the same framework, i.e. Bayesian hierarchical generalized regression models. We will spend a lot of time learning to understand and specify these types of models. However, we will focus mainly on learning how to implement and work with these models, rather than spending time looking at the formal math. Here, I will follow the approach taken by McElreath (2020), who emphasises that even mathematicians may have trouble understanding something until they see a working algorithm.\nTherefore, this workshop will be very hands-on. Everything we do will be illustrated with working code examples, and you are encouraged to try every single line of code for yourself.\nOutline\nFriday, May 21\nWe will start with a general introduction to Bayesian inference, followed by an intro to the programming language Stan, and the R packages rstan and brms. Since we will be working almost exclusively with brms therafter, it is important to spend a bit of time here.\nWe will dive straight into Bayesian inference here, without spending too much time on frequentist methods and the differences between the two approaches (we will focus on this mode when we get to model comparisons).\nWe will then explore how models can be implemented as general (or generalized) linear models, and we will introduce multilevel models as a natural way of modelling reapeated measurements.\nFriday, May 28\nSaturday, May 29\nFriday, June 4\nPrerequisites\nBasic knowledge of regression models and R is a necessity. I strongly recommend that you prepare for the workshop by working through this online script: https://methodenlehre.github.io/intro-to-rstats. Previous exposure to multilevel models and longitudinal models would be helpful, but is not strictly necessary. Knowledge of Bayesian statistics is not required.\nSoftware\nWe will be using R and RStudio, as well a variety of R packages. It is advisable to ensure that you have a working R installation before the workshop starts, and that you install the two R packages rstan and brms. Detailed instructions for installing these packages on all platforms can be found at https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started and https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms.\nAssignments\nWe will focus on learning new topics during the morning sessions, and participants should work through the assignments during the afternoon sessions. Participants are also encouraged to bring their own datasets.\nZulip\nThe Zulip chat server will be our communicatin platform for this workshop. We will use this for questions, assignments, troubleshooting, etc. Zulip can be used for synchronous or asynchronous chats, and has very good threading capabilities. Zulip is also pretty easy to use, and uses Markdown for message formatting. This means that you can use Markdown to format code and equations.\n\n\n\nMcElreath, Richard. 2020.

Participants will learn how to fit models using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, although the focus will be on Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison. We will start with a short introduction to multilevel modelling and to Bayesian statistics in general, followed by an introduction to Stan, a probabilistic programming language for fitting Bayesian models. We will then learn how to use the R package brms, which provides a user-friendly interface to Stan. The package supports a wide range of response distributions and modelling options, and allows us to fit multilevel generalized linear models. Depending on participants’ wishes, we will take a closer look at modelling various types of data, such as choices, response times, ordinal or longitudinal data.\nSpecific topics include:\nBayesian inference: an introduction\nBayesian parameter estimation\nModel comparison & hypothesis testing\nBayes factors\nOut-of-sample predictive accuracy (LOO)\n\nSpecifying multilevel generalized linear models\nUnderstanding statistical models through data simulation\nA principled Bayesian workflow for data analysis\nYour expectations/questions\nSince most of you expressed an interest in Bayesian statistics, we will mostly multilevel generalized regression models from this perspective.\nSpecific topics\nadvantages of Bayesian over frequentist statistics\nhow to select priors\npreparing data\nbinary (choice) data\nresponse times\nrepeated measures and other hierarchical (multilevel) designs, inlcuding longitudinal data\ncrossed random effects, e.g. lexical decision tasks\ncategorical variables\nmoderation / mediation\nSEM (structural equation models)\nmodel comparison / hypothesis testing in mixed effects models\ndyadic data\nnonlinear regression\n\n\n\n",
