      "contents": "\nThe talk will be about Bayesian multilevel models and their implementation in R using the package brms. We will start with a short introduction to multilevel modeling and to Bayesian statistics in general followed by an introduction to Stan, which is a flexible language for fitting open-ended Bayesian models. We will then explain how to access Stan using the standard R formula syntax via the brms package. The package supports a wide range of response distributions and modeling options such as splines, autocorrelation, and censoring all in a multilevel context. A lot of post-processing and plotting methods are implemented as well. Some examples from Psychology and Medicine will be discussed.\n\n\n\n",
