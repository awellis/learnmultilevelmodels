Participants will learn how to fit models using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, although the focus will be on Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison. We will start with a short introduction to multilevel modelling and to Bayesian statistics in general, followed by an introduction to Stan, a probabilistic programming language for fitting Bayesian models. We will then learn how to use the R package brms, which provides a user-friendly interface to Stan. The package supports a wide range of response distributions and modelling options, and allows us to fit multilevel generalized linear models. Depending on participantsâ€™ wishes, we will take a closer look at modelling various types of data, such as choices, response times, ordinal or longitudinal data.\nSpecific topics include:\nBayesian inference: an introduction\nBayesian parameter estimation\nModel comparison & hypothesis testing\nBayes factors\nOut-of-sample predictive accuracy (LOO)\n\nSpecifying multilevel generalized linear models\nUnderstanding statistical models through data simulation\nA principled Bayesian workflow for data analysis\nWe will focus on learning new topics during the morning sessions, and participants should work through the assignments during the afternoon sessions. Participants are also encouraged to bring their own datasets.\nPrerequisites\nBasic knowledge of regression models and R is a necessity. I strongly recommend that you prepare for the workshop by working through this online script: https://methodenlehre.github.io/intro-to-rstats. Previous exposure to multilevel models and longitudinal models would be helpful, but is not strictly necessary. Knowledge of Bayesian statistics is not required.\nSoftware\nWe will be using R and RStudio, as well a variety of R packages. It is advisable to ensure that you have a working R installation before the workshop starts, and that you install the two R packages rstan and brms. Detailed instructions for installing these packages on all platforms can be found at https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started and https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms.\n\n\n\n",
